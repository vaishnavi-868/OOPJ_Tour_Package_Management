# OOPJ_Tour_Package_Management
A Tour Package Management Project in Object-Oriented Programming in Java (OOPJ) is designed to simulate the operations of a travel agency. The project incorporates core OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to manage tour packages effectively.

This project is a comprehensive travel booking application designed to simplify the process of planning and booking trips across India. Upon launching the application, users are prompted to select the direction of their travel, with options including North, South, East, and West. Based on their selection, the application dynamically displays a variety of travel packages available in that particular direction.

Once a direction is chosen, users are asked to specify the number of travelers in their group. The application then presents them with a range of options for accommodation, including 3-star, 4-star, 5-star, and 7-star hotels, ensuring that there is something to suit every budget and preference.

One of the unique features of this application is its focus on culinary experiences. Users are given the choice between vegetarian and non-vegetarian food options, with the application showcasing the regional delicacies available in each location. This allows travelers to not only explore new destinations but also indulge in the local cuisine, adding a delicious dimension to their journey.

To ensure a seamless booking experience, users are required to input their desired travel date, which must fall within one year from the current date. The application then proceeds to create an account for the user on Voyage Ventures, a platform dedicated to facilitating travel experiences. As an added security measure, an OTP (One-Time Password) is generated for verification, combining the last 2 digits of the user's phone number with the first 2 digits of their emergency phone number.

In terms of payment options, the application supports a variety of modern payment methods, allowing users to pay for their trip in a single transaction or in convenient installments. This flexibility ensures that users can book their dream vacation with ease, regardless of their financial circumstances.

Overall, this travel booking application is designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience, from the moment they start planning their trip to the moment they return home with unforgettable memories
